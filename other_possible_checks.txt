* viable in first round, receiving less votes in final alignment
-> this is partially checked in lessfinalcandidate.py, but I don't have a function to check for viability since I don't understand/know all the different weird requirements
* check for SDE allocation sum differences to how many a precinct actually had to give out
* and follow-up, check how many SDEs each candidate should have had
